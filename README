Beverage Classifier using CLIP
Soda – Orange Juice – Water Classification (No Training Required)

This project uses CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) from HuggingFace to classify an input image into one of three beverage categories:

-Soda
-Orange Juice
-Water

CLIP allows classification without training, simply by comparing the image to text descriptions. This makes the project extremely lightweight and plug-and-play.

First we need to install the dependences, you can put this command: "pip install -r requirements.txt" and it will read the txt file to install the dependences 

If you want to install manually:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install pillow
pip install transformers

To classify an image, run:

python classify_clip.py path_file.jpg (name of your image to process)

How It Works

CLIP takes an image and analize what kind of drink are in the photo, a photo of a soda, juice or water

It print the prediction and a scale of percent of that prediction


-Why this is powerful

CLIP understands concepts, not fixed labels.

It doesn't need training — it already understands the world.

Works excellent for beverages, containers, textures, etc.

This is how we use "trasnfer learning" or non superviced learning.
